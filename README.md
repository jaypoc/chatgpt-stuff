# ChatGPT Stuff

Just playing around with ChatGPT, I asked it to create a web page that I could interact with it by talking through a webpage. It obliged :)

Thought I'd share it here. You'll need your own OpenAPI Key in order to use it yourself.

* Chat GPT wrote all this code. It didn't work as the JS was executing before the dom was done loading. I moved the JS below the HTML. 
* The page loaded, and I could speak to it, but the OpenAI API wasn't working. ChatGPT recommended an old endpoint. I had to look up the OpenAI Docs. Fixed.
* I didn't have credits :) I had to pay for some...

It works now. I can talk with the webpage and it answers back :)

Not super fancy, but ChatGPT gave me a great starting point allowing me to build a working prototype in about 30 minutes.
